# Todo

This app should be able to:

- Add a task
- See all the tasks
- Mark the tasks that are ready/not ready
- Remove a task
- See how many tasks there are in total
- Every file has its own responsibility for readability. Even Empty State has its own file.

The app should be simle and easy to use. A header, an inputfield with an add-button. Then the todos comes up underneath. Maybe also showing date and time and when the todo was posted. I saw a nice color-combination on Pinterest and use that in my app. 

I am using Zustand since its a requiery for this course.

Full Accessibility will be applied.

For styling I use Styled-components.
